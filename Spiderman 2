This is a copy off of dream and Georges spiderman plugin that I coded

commands: spidey
for 1.15.2

once you type that in it works, just have to right click with any item in hand except for throwables, food, and projectile based weapons. Oh and a sheild,
also if you have one of the listed items in your offhand.

some other things to know about this is that if you fall before 2.5 second after you hit a block with the web you will take reduced damage

between 3 - 10, half a heart
between 10 - 20, one heart
between 20 - 30, one and a half hearts
and anything above 30 blocks is two hearts.

if you hit a mob it will be pulled back to you, one of the main things George didnt code, at least i think.

that should be it, enjoy!
